# VOIS_CICD_EKS_Terraform

This repository contains the Terraform code and configurations for deploying a CI/CD pipeline on AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) as part of the VOIS task.

The CI/CD pipeline is designed to automate the deployment of applications using Kubernetes. It utilizes infrastructure as code principles to provision the necessary AWS resources and Kubernetes infrastructure, and then configures a CI/CD workflow using Jenkins.

This repository is created as part of the VOIS task and serves as a demonstration of deploying a private EKS cluster, using a bastion host for secure communication, and configuring a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins
